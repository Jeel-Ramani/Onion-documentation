:::info What we're doing in this step

Now that you’ve transferred the compiled package to the Omega, you’ll use the opkg package manager to install the package. Opkg will also install any package dependencies.

:::

On your Omega:

```shell
cd /tmp
```

You can do a `ls -l` to see the ipk file.

```shell
opkg update
```

To install a generic package:

```shell
opkg install <package ipk file name>
```
