You will need the following set up and software installed to follow along with the example.

- A development computer  
  - Running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.
  - Access to terminal/command line
  - Git installed
  - Docker installed and running
    - **Tip**: For those new to Docker, see [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and the manual on [running a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run).

    - **Important Note on Macs with Apple Silicon:** The OpenWRT build system, SDK, and Image Builder expect an x86_64 processor architecture. Attempting to build in a Docker container on a Mac with Apple Silicon will result in compilation errors. We recommend using an x86_64 machine for best results. Some users have reported successful compilation if Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon is enabled in Docker.

  

- An Omega2 device
  - Set up and connected to the internet. See the [quickstart guide](../../quickstart/intro) for details.
