**Step 4:** Copy the compiled ipk file from the Docker container to your development computer's file system.

In the Docker container, run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir openwrt-sdk/package/apps/output
cp openwrt-sdk/bin/packages/mipsel_24kc/base/*.ipk openwrt-sdk/package/apps/output
 ```

Outside the Docker container in the top level directory of the source code, run `ls -l output` to see the contents of the output directory.

You'll see `c-example_1.0-1_mipsel_24kc.ipk` listed, which is the file you're interested in.

**Note:** To run the commands outside of the Docker container, either use a new terminal window or type exit to stop the container.

The procedure in your example uses a slightly modified method than the one in the article, but the same principles apply.
