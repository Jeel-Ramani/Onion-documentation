Since your program executable is installed in `/usr/bin`, and `/usr/bin` is in the PATH variable, you can just call the executable name directly.

:::note Linux PATH variable

The PATH variable has a list of directories the system checks before running a command. It allows you to run executables in those directories without using the absolute path â€“ this is good for time saving.
