:::info Macs with Apple Silicon

The OpenWRT build system, SDK, and Image Builder expect an x86_64 processor architecture. Attempting to build in a Docker container on a Mac with Apple silicon will result in compilation errors. We recommend using an x86_64 machine for best results.

Some users have reported successful compilation on Apple Silicon if QEMU or Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation is enabled in Docker, and the  `--platform linux/amd64` flag is added to the Docker `pull` and `run` commands shown below.
