:::tip

For those new to Docker, see [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and the manual on [running a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run).

:::

To start a Docker container running Ubuntu 22.04, make sure Docker is installed and running, and then run the following command:

```
docker run -it ubuntu:22.04 /bin/bash
```

:::info Macs with Apple Silicon

The OpenWRT build system, SDK, and Image Builder expect an x86_64 processor architecture. Attempting to build in a Docker container on a Mac with Apple silicon will result in compilation errors. We recommend using an x86_64 machine for best results.

Some users have reported successful compilation if Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon is enabled in Docker.
