When using Ubuntu 22.04 Linux or newer, you need to install the software packages required to use the OpenWRT build tools. These can be installed using the packager manager.

Please see the [OpenWRT Build System Setup instructions](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/install-buildsystem#debianubuntumint) for details on which packages need to be installed and the commands to run for installation.
