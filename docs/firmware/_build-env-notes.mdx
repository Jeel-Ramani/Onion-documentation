<span>The OpenWRT build tools, including the {props.tool}, are meant to run on Linux.</span>
<br/><br/>
There are several methods to do this:

- Dedicated Linux computer
- Linux server (AWS EC2)
- Docker virtual machine
- Other virtual machines (WSL, VirtualBox, etc.)

#### Recommended Method

**The method recommended by Onion is to use Linux in a Docker container.** Using Docker provides isolation, which helps prevent dependency conflicts with existing software on the host system and ensures a clean, reproducible development environment.

**Onion recommends using the `onion/openwrt-builder` Docker image.** This Docker image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and has all of the [software packages required to use the OpenWRT build tools](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/install-buildsystem#debianubuntumint) already installed. 

:::tip

For those new to Docker, see [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and the manual on [running a Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run).
