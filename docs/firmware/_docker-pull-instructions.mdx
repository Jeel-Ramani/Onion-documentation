To download the `onion/openwrt-builder` Docker image, make sure Docker is installed and running, and run the following command:

```
docker pull onion/openwrt-builder
```

:::note Only needs to be done once

It might take a few minutes to download the Docker image depending on your internet connection. After the image downloads, you won't need to download it again and this step can be skipped next time.
