To start a Docker container based on the `onion/openwrt-builder` image run the following command:

```
docker run -it onion/openwrt-builder /bin/bash
```

You should see something similar to:

```shell
~ docker run -it onion/openwrt-builder /bin/bash
root@385d649fdab7:~#
```

You are now inside the Docker container.
