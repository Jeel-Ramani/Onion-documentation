# I2C

The firmware includes the kernel modules needed to use the hardware I2C bus as well as the `i2c-tools` command line tools.

The I2C bus interface is available at `/dev/i2c-0`

See the [i2c-tools documentation](https://linuxhint.com/i2c-linux-utilities/) to learn how to use the individual commands.
