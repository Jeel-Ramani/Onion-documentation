To check the IP address given to the Omega:

```shell
ifconfig apcli0
```

This will return the following information.

![omega2-ip-address-check](./assets/omega2-ip-address-check.png)

Note the highlighted IP address `inet addr:`.

If that line is blank, the Omega was not given an IP address. Double check the network configuration and try again.
