title: One-Wire Devices
---

One-wire devices including but not limited to temperature loggers, battery monitors, humidity sensors, voltage and current sensors can be used with the Omega2 family of modules through One-wire communication protocol.

Letâ€™s get started ðŸš€

## What is a One-Wire Device

A One-Wire device is an electronic component that communicates using the One-Wire protocol, enabling communication with a host system using a single data line. These components are specifically designed to function on a One-Wire bus and can contain an array of integrated circuits (ICs) such as sensors, memory chips, or other peripherals.

Every One-Wire device connected to a network has its unique 64-bit address (a.k.a ROM code), enabling the host system to communicate with any specific device(s) on the One-Wire bus.

## What is a One-Wire Protocol

The One-Wire protocol is a communication protocol that establishes a low-speed communication bridge between One-Wire Devices and processors/micro-controllers over a single data line. With a single data line as a communication methodology, the wiring process is tremendously simplified and the number of pins required to bridge the connection is also reduced. 

One Wire protocol follows a master-slave architecture with each bus allowing for one master, in this case, an Omega2 board, and a slave device like the DS18B20 temperature sensor.

## Connect a One-Wire Device to the Omega2

This section covers a three-stage process for establishing the physical wiring connection of your One-Wire device to GPIO19, where the latter will serve the role of the One-Wire master.

### Stage 1: Identify the Connectors

One-Wire devices have three available connectors/wires as illustrated in the table below: 

| Wire            | Connection                                                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| VCC             | Connect this wire to the 3.3V power source on the Omega2 board. |  
| GND             | Connect this wire to the ground pin on the Omega2 board.        |  
| DQ              | Connect this wire to the GPIO19 pin on the Omega2 board.        |

:::note

Please refer to your specific One-Wire device's datasheet to identify the pins and determine the recommended voltage. 

:::

:::tip

Building these connections is relatively easy if you have an Expansion, Power, or Arduino Dock since they all expose the Omegaâ€™s GPIOs. 

:::

:::warning

Some One-Wire devices will require a pull-up resistor on the Data line (DQ). For example, the popular DS18B20 temperature sensor requires a 4.7 kÎ© pull-up resistor on the DQ to operate properly.

:::


### Stage 2: Connect Power & Ground

Connect the power and ground wires belonging to your One-Wire device to the corresponding power and ground pins on the Omega2 board. 

### Stage 3: Connect the DQ

Connect the DQ from your One-Wire device to the GPIO19 pin on the Omega2 board. 

## Enable One-Wire Device Support


Once the physical connections are made, install dts overlay package to register a one-wire master in Linux associated with GPIO19 to communicate with the one-wire slave device.  

**Step 1:**  Install the `onion-dt-overlay-w1-gpio` package using opkg

```
opkg install onion-dt-overlay-w1-gpio
```
**Step 2:** After the package is successfully installed, GPIO19 will act as a One-Wire Master. 

```
/sys/devices/w1_bus_master1
```
<h2 id="find">Find Connected One-Wire Devices</h2>

**Step 1:** Navigate to the relevant directory where One-Wire devices are listed. This is under `/sys/devices/w1_bus_master1`


```
cd /sys/devices/w1_bus_master1
ls
```

**Step 2:** Perform a check to find if slave devices are connected or not. 

```
cat /sys/devices/w1_bus_master1/w1_master_slave_count
```

**Step 3:** The command in step 2 will return the count of the number of slave devices connected. 

| Result            | Interpretation                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1                 | A slave device is connected               |
| 0                 | A slave device is connected               |

:::note

The One-Wire bus master kernel module scans the data pin every 10 seconds for new devices connected, if any, hence, it is recommended to wait a little while and try again. 

:::

**Step 4:** If a slave device is connected, run the following command: 

```
cat/sys/devices/w1_bus_master1/w1_master_slaves
```

This will return a (newline delimited) list of your slave device ID(s). 

:::note

The `Device ID` is the serial number of your One-Wire device. Example of a device ID: 28-000123456789. 

:::

:::note

Each device will have a different serial number, making it complex to use One-Wire devices programmatically. 

:::

:::tip

Please keep a record of the `Device ID` as the same will be used when reading the data from the connected one-wire device (as discussed in the section).

:::

## Read Data from a Connected One-Wire Device

**Step 1:** Navigate to the specific slave device directory and access the data from the __w1_slave file__ by running the following command: 

```
cat /sys/devices/w1_bus_master1/DeviceID/w1_slave
```

The `DeviceID` in the command above is the serial number of your One-Wire device we noted in the previous section. Please refer to **Step 4** of the command section "Find Connected One-Wire Devices" to learn more about finding the "DeviceID". 

Assuming the slave device is a temperature sensor "DS18B20", having a serial number- 28-000123456789, the command will be: 

```
cat /sys/devices/w1_bus_master1/28-000123456789/w1_slave
```

**Step 2:** The command executed in **Step 1** will return the raw data from the connected One-Wire device. 

Example of the raw data from the connected temperature sensor like the DS18B20: 

```
b1 01 4b 46 7f ff 0c 10 d8 : crc=d8 YES
b1 01 4b 46 7f ff 0c 10 d8 t=27062
```

In the sample raw data above, the final `t=27062` indicates the temperature is 27.062 ËšC.

## Common Pitfalls and Precautions

- Cross-check your wiring to make sure that VCC, GND, and DQ lines are correctly connected because incorrect wiring might lead to communication issues.  

- Please ensure that the One-wire deviceâ€™s dataline is connected to GPIO19. 

- While connecting the One-Wire device to the Omega2 board, refer to the datasheet and documentation for your specific One-Wire device for detailed wiring and configuration instructions.

- Some One-Wire devices will require a pull-up resistor on the Data line (DQ). For example, the popular DS18B20 temperature sensor requires a 4.7 kÎ© pull-up resistor on the DQ to operate properly
