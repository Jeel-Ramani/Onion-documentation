title: Quickstart Overview

<!-- NOTE: Ok to keep OpenWRT release numbers hard-coded in this article -->

This quickstart guide covers the quickest way to get up and running with an Omega2 Device. It applies to all Omega2 devices running the updated firmware, which is based on OpenWRT 23.05.

### Upgrading firmware from v0.3.4

For devices running the Omega2 firmware v0.3.4, please see the instructions found in the [Installing the New Firmware](/firmware/installing-firmware) article and then return to this article.

> To get started with a device running the v0.3.4 firmware, please see the first time setup article in our legacy documentation: [https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/first-time-setup.html). **Note the legacy first time setup will not work with the new firmware!**

If you're unsure how to tell the difference between the "New" firmware and the previous v0.3.4 firmware, see the [article on identifying the firmware version](../introduction/determine-fw-version).

### Recommended hardware

Onion recommends the following hardware setup for ease of use:

#### For Omega2/2+

- Omega2 or Omega2+ device
- Expansion dock

#### For Omega2S/2S+

- Omega2S Development Kit. Please see the getting started guide on our GitHub site: [https://github.com/OnionIoT/Omega2/blob/master/Documents/Omega2S%20Dev%20Kit%20-%20Getting%20Started.pdf](https://github.com/OnionIoT/Omega2/blob/master/Documents/Omega2S%20Dev%20Kit%20-%20Getting%20Started.pdf)

#### Additional required materials

You'll need a computer and a microUSB to USB cable in addition to the Omega2 hardware.

### Overview of the process

In this first article, we cover the unboxing and powering up of your Omega2. Then we’ll cover connecting to the Omega’s command line and WiFi in separate articles within the QuickStart section. Finally, we'll explore running a Hello World demo program using Python.
