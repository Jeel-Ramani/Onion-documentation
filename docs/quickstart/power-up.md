## Step 1: Unbox the device

Unpack your Omega2 Eval Board

### Ensure the Omega is plugged in to the Eval Board 

**Through-hole Omega2 only**

Make sure the Omega2 is plugged into the socket on the Eval Board and the Omega's pins are securely seated in the socket.

On the Omega2S Eval Board, the surface-mount Omega2S module is soldered down to the Eval Board, so this step is not necessary.

## Step 2: Connect the Eval Board to a computer

Plug the USB cable into the USB-C port on the Omega2 Eval Board and connect the other end to a USB port on your computer. This provides power to the Omega as well as a connection with Omega2â€™s command line.


:::note

The Omega2 Eval Boards have voltage regulators so the USB port can power the Omega2 with the required 3.3Vdc.

## Step 3: Power on

Turn on your Omega2 using the switch.

### Wait until it boots

The amber LED on your Omega2 should turn on and start blinking after a few seconds. The LED will stop blinking and remain solid after about a minutes. This means your Omega2 has completed its boot sequence.
