The Power switch controls the power going to the Omega2 module. Use it to manually turn the device on or off.

Note the switch only controls power to the Omega2 module, but not the USB-to-Serial chip. Meaning a connected computer will still detect a USB serial device even when the Omega is powered off, but will it not be able to communicate with the Omega in this case.
