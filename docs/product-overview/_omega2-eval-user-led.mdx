<span>A blue user programmable LED is built into the {props.device}. It is controlled through GPIO{props.gpio}.</span>

<!-- TODO: figure out how to make a newline here (currently rendered on same line as above)-->
It is up to the user how to use the LED. In general, a user programmable LED can:

- Show status - Show code is configured, installed, and running correctly.
- Help with debugging programs in real-time, where you can program it to blink different patterns based on what code is executing.
