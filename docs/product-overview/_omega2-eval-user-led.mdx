<span>A blue user programmable LED is built into the {props.device}. It is controlled by GPIO{props.gpio}.<br/><br/></span>

It is up to the user how to use the LED. In general, a user programmable LED can:

- Show status - For example, to show code is configured, installed, running correctly, or a certain condition has been met
- Help with debugging programs in real-time, where you can program it to blink different patterns based on what code is executing.

See the [Hello World demo](/quickstart/hello-world-demo) in the Quickstart guide for an example of using Python to control the user programmable LED.
