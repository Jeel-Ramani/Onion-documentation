<span>The Omega2 has a single 10/100M integrated Ethernet Physical Layer (PHY). The {props.device} features an RJ45 Ethernet port to enable easy wired networking.<br/><br/></span>

By default, the Ethernet port interface acts as a DCHP client. It expects to receive an IP address from a DHCP server on the network (a router or similar). The Ethernet port interface can also be configured to act as the network host and DHCP host/server, assigning IP addresses to connected clients.

See the article on [Ethernet Networking](/networking/ethernet) for more details on using the Ethernet port.
