The on-board RJ45 Ethernet port allows for easy wired networking. The Omega2 supports 10M/100M wired networking.

By default, the Ethernet port acts as a DCHP client. It expects to receive an IP address from a DHCP server on the network (a router or similar). 
<!-- TODO: mention it can be configured to DHCP host  -->

See the article on [Ethernet Networking](/networking/ethernet) for more details on using the Ethernet port.
