The Reset Button is connected directly to the Omega2 Soft Reset pin (GPIO38). Pressing this button does one of two things: 

1. Reboot
1. Factory restore

#### Reboot

Momentarily pressing the reset button and letting go will initiate a reboot of the Linux operating system.

#### Factory Restore

Pressing and holding the reset button for 10 seconds then releasing will trigger a factory restore.

A factory restore will reset your Omega to the default filesystem of the last firmware update, this will delete ALL of your data!
