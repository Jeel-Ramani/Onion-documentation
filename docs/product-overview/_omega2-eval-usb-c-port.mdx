#### Power
The USB-C port accepts regular 5V USB power and an onboard voltage regulator circuit steps down the voltage to the 3.3V required by the Omega2.

#### Serial Command Line Access
An on-board USB-to-Serial chip provides always-on access to the serial command line. See the [Serial Command Line step in the Quickstart Guide](/quickstart/serial-command-line) for more information on using the serial command line.
