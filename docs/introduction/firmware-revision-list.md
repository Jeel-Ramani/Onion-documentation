## Context: The previous firmware v0.3.4

The previous Omega2 stable firmware (v0.3.4) is based on OpenWRT 18.06, and it's running the Linux kernel 4.14.

**Note:** The v0.3.4 numbering will end with this version. It will be replaced with the new current stable firmware numbering convention.

The current Omega2 stable firmware (23.05.3) is based on OpenWRT 23.05, and it's running the Linux kernel 5.15.

## Highlights
